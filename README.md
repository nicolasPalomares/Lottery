# Lottery
A nice and simple lottery program / "game" made with Java

This program represents a sort of "simulation" of a lottery, in which the user enters by command line arguments an amount to bet; if that amount is a negative number, an exception is thrown. Next, the user is asked to enter three numbers from 0 to 60, then the thread is executed and shows fifteen numbers in console. The numbers (located in an array) are always shuffled before the execution of the thread so that the program depends on luck. At the end, the user is rewarded depending on how many numbers were correct: from winning nothing to having tripled the bet.

Program was made with JDK 18.
